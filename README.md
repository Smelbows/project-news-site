# News Site

Technigo week two project:
An individual assignment to create a responsive news site landing page using Grid and/or Flexbox in CSS. The requirements were to have a header with a responsive logo, heading and nav bar, a 'big news' section, and a section of articles which were displayed differently on mobile, tablet and desktop.

## The problem

Planning:
I began by browsing a number of different news sites and then planning on paper what I wanted my site to include and what I wanted it to look like on different devices. Then I wrote as much of the html, including adding classes, as possible so that when I started working on the CSS I could see how it would affect the entire page. At the midpoint and end of each day I came back to the project brief to check that I was focussing on the most immediate problem. I used timeboxing when I needed to if one area or issue was taking longer that I'd originally anticipated.

Technologies:
I used "coolers.co" to help choose a colour palatte and developer.mozilla.org, w3schools.com and Google to help with CSS basics. I used codespot.org to find and try out some hover effects.

Improvments:
With more time I would like to fix the sizing and spacing issues in the CSS grid section (the news cards). I would also like to change the layout style of the nav bar so that the icons and links are exactly where I want them to be on all devices. I also planned to create a 'burger' style nav menu for browsing on mobile.
